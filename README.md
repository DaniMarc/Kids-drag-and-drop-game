# Kids-drag-and-drop-game

The idea is very simple: the game needs you to focus and drag the animal to its corresponding type: wild or tamed.
Each game consists of 10 rounds and you are scored out of 10.

### The target audience are the kids ranging from 7 so 10 years old.
***My mom is a primary school teacher so I made this one for her :)***

# Language and framework choice 
## Python + TKinter
As I am finishing this project (*September 2021*) I am about to begin my 2nd University year. 
* in the first semester of this 1st year we had a class called **Fundamentals of programming** where, as it says, we studied the fundamentals of programming using Python, so I thought I would gain a little bit of more experience with this pleasent, nice and easy to write programming language
* in the second semester we had the class **OOP** where we studied mainly C++ and the Qt Framework, but since the language choice was Python (3.10) for its Swiss Army Knife capabilities I had to go with Tkinter for the GUI (had the occasion of seeing the similarities of the two frameworks and refreshing the principles of widget-based GUIs)

# Conclusions
I had a lot of fun doing this little project and learned a lot :)
If you know some kid/teacher that would enjoy this little program **OR** even if you want to learn Python, feel free to take it, giving credits where credits are due.
